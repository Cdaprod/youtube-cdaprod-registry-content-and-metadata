    "content": "Hey there, Code N Triplets! In this video, we're exploring **Autonomous Components**\u2014self-managing modules that operate independently within Middleware-Infrastructure. Autonomous components can handle their own lifecycle, scaling, and failure recovery, contributing to the overall resilience of the system. We'll discuss principles like single responsibility, self-healing, and decentralized control. By empowering components to manage themselves, you create a more robust and efficient middleware ecosystem. Let's build smarter, autonomous systems!"
