    "description": "Explore modular design patterns that underpin Middleware-Infrastructure. Learn how to create independent, interchangeable modules for a cohesive system.",
    "content": "Welcome back, Code N Triplets! In this session, we're focusing on **Modular Design Patterns**. Modular design is all about breaking down your system into manageable, independent components that can be developed, tested, and maintained separately. We'll cover common patterns like microservices, service-oriented architecture (SOA), and how to implement them effectively within Middleware-Infrastructure. Discover how modularity enhances flexibility, facilitates parallel development, and simplifies scaling. Let's piece together the perfect modular architecture!"
