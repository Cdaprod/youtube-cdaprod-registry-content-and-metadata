    "content": "Hello Code N Triplets! In our final episode, episode 16, we're focusing on **Error Handling and Reliability** in Middleware-Infrastructure. Building a fault-tolerant system is essential, and actors play a significant role in achieving this. We'll cover strategies for handling errors gracefully, supervising actors, and ensuring that failures in one part of the system don't cascade and cause widespread issues. Additionally, we'll discuss monitoring and recovery techniques that keep our middleware running smoothly even under unexpected conditions. Join me as we ensure our system is both reliable and resilient!"
