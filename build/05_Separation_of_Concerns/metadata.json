    "content": "Hello Code N Triplets! Today, we're discussing **Separation of Concerns (SoC)**, a fundamental principle in software design. SoC involves dividing a system into distinct sections, each handling a specific aspect of functionality. In Middleware-Infrastructure, this means separating data management, business logic, and user interface components. We'll explore the benefits of SoC, such as improved clarity, easier maintenance, and enhanced scalability. By adhering to this principle, you ensure that each part of your system remains focused and efficient. Let's separate and conquer!"
